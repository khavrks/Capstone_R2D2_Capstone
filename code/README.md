Our project has 60000 lines of code and 5 different programs that were created during this time so it is very hard to explain everything in a few paragraphs. So we will try to give you an overview of our project and how we got there. We will try to explain the different parts of our project and how they work together. As some code not even loaded to github and some of the code we think should be private we only showing the code snippets that would give you good overview of our project. In the end we will show you the end result and how you can use it.
